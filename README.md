# Hi there! 👋🏻

I am currently pursuing MSc in Cybersecurity at [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://ntu.edu.sg).
Prior to this, I lectured foundation and diploma level subjects part-time at [Taylor's College, Malaysia](https://college.taylors.edu.my).
My current interests revolve around software testing, software security, teaching, and curriculum development.
I enjoy indulging myself with Math as an enthusiast, playing casual video games and watching comedy routines as my pasttime, just to name a few.
I may occasionally take time off to help friends and peers with their studies, or to pick up a new development skill.

## Some stuff I've been working on:

- 📝 [Study Notes Repo](https://henryheng612.com/notes)

  Something still in the works, I plan to revisit my study notes and have them memorialized in a soft-copy format redone in GoodNotes!
  I have also included lecture notes that were prepared during my time teaching here as well.

## Some stuff I previously worked on:

- 🤖 [ChatGPT RCA Tool](https://github.com/deezombiedude612/rca-tool)

  Implemented a root cause analysis (RCA) tool to analyze outputs of stack traces coming from software crashes as part of an ongoing capstone project.
  Gave myself a challenge to dabble with NodeJS and TypeScript here for the first time!

- 💻 Practical Lab websites

  Created using Material for MkDocs (formerly VuePress v1 on GitHub Pages).
  It was just something to shake up the way how my practical labs for some of my modules are conveyed to my students.
  I plan on creating one definitive site that will contain all that's done below, as well as make more if and when my time and focus permit!
  Right now, they're pretty much defunct and all plans here are in the backburner.

  **NOTE TO SELF:** Look into Docusaurus, it uses React.
