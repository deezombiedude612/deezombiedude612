# What's up.. Henry here! 👋🏻

I currently work as a part-time lecturer concentrating on foundation and diploma level modules at Taylor's College, Malaysia.
Prior to this, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Taylor's University](https://university.taylors.edu.my) in 2018.
My current interests revolve around technology, teaching and education in general.
I enjoy indulging myself with Math as an enthusiast, playing video games and watching comedy routines as my pasttime, just to name a few.
I may occasionally take time off to help friends and peers with their studies, or to pick up a new development skill.

## Some stuff I've been working on:

- 📝 Notes Repo (something in the works, I plan to revisit my study notes and have them memorialized in a soft-copy format redone in GoodNotes!)
- 💻 Practical Lab website (hosted with VuePress on GitHub Pages); something to shake up the way how my practical labs for some of my modules are conveyed to my students
  - [ITS30605 Web Programming](https://deezombiedude612.github.io/wp-labs)
  - [ITS42004 Object-Oriented Programming](https://deezombiedude612.github.io/oop-labs)
